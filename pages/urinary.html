            <h1>Period pain</h1>
            <h3>Period pain is common and a normal part of your menstrual cycle. Most women get it at some point in
                their lives.It's usually felt as painful muscle cramps in the tummy, which can spread to the back
                and
                thighs.
                The pain sometimes comes in intense spasms, while at other times it may be dull but more constant.
                It may also vary with each period. Some periods may cause little or no discomfort, while others may
                be
                more painful. Sometimes you may get pelvic pain even when you do not have your period.</h3>
